# Code School Badges

This is a demo app which connects with the <http://node-soup.herokuapp.com/>
WebSocket server.

## Running

Install dependencies with `npm install`.  
Run with `node app.js`.  

Visit <http://localhost:3001> and you should see a message printed to the JavaScript console every time
a new *badge* event is emitted from the WebSocket server.
